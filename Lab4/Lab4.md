The first thing we changed was the grammar of one of the sentences in chapter 14: Jails. It was a run-on sentence that wasn't a very good read, so we inserted parentheses to help the flow of the sentence.

The second thing we changed was a term that was used in a sentence a little after the sentence mentioned above. It had a term in it that didn't make much sense. The term was chrooted, and we changed it to "chroot-ed."

The third thing we changed was "on screen" to "on-screen" in 5.2 of Terminology.

It is important to maintain good documentation to make sure that any users will be motivated to use the code, and it will make it easier for them to understand it.

From this lab, I have learned the importance of good documentation for the code that I create.
