  The 10 Criteria of the Open Source Definition are important, because they ensure that any member of Github that wishes to redistribute, modify, or simply play around with the source code will be able to do so easily without any restrictions. The fact that open source software is free to redistribute maintains the thought of freely sharing source code that was not produced with the incentive of profit, but for the ability to post code that can be seen and used by other interested users. The point of code being "open source" wouldn't make sense unless it was shared as freely and as easily as possible to *everyone*.

  Regarding Eric Raymond's article, "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way," he gives some great tips on how to ask and answer questions on websites, such as Stack Overflow, when dealing with a technical problem. He explains how to research the problem before asking, how and where the question should be asked, and how to respond to the answers you receive. Raymond also puts into perspective the users that usually answer the technical questions.  When a question is posted on Stack Overflow, the exchange is not a one-way street. The users answering the question are there to solve interesting problems or to simply help out other users in the community, but they aren't there to hold your hand. They expect you to follow along and try to understand the problem and its solution, not to just ask for the code and walk away. The post should be to give those users an exciting way to engage in their hobby, not to waste their time. Active participation is expected.
  
Two suggestions for ways to answer questions in a helpful way would be:
  - To try and put yourself in their shoes
  - To be patient
