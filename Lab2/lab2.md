##Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?

It is important to choose a license, because it is a statement that you are willing to let other users freely run, modify, and share the code that you post. Also, chooses a license dictates the legal conditions of whoever uses it, e.g. whether or not someone can sue the creator if the code messes up their machine.

##Why SHOULDN'T they use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?

Without a license, the code is "all rights reserved." No user other than the creator(s) will have the legal ability to anything with the code, and they will stay away from it. If the users don't have the rights, they won't want to consider helping you.

##Why Gopher failed and HTTP survived - Do you agree with this claim?

Yes, I agree with this claim. Gopher already made a huge mistake by not releasing their software early in order to build a community of users to help them with the coding. If there aren't many people involved in the creation of the code, there won't be many people who will 1. know about the creation and 2. use it.  Also, giving a discount to those associated with education (people who have .edu domains) went against the hacker ethic of discriminating against how certain groups of users can use the code.

##Can you justify why such a license is chosen (Justify for ONE is enough). Instead of these four, you can look at any other software project and justify the license chosen for that project.

Looking at the RCOS RPI Tours project, they used the MIT license. It would make sense to use this license, since it is a very open license and it would be a good idea to get all the help you can get from the GitHub community (especially when doing a project in college). In order to maximize the number of users that could potentially help, you would get a license that would attract the most, i.e. the one with the least restrictions.

##Which license is better?

The Apache/BSD licenses are the better choice when compared to the GPL and LGPL licenses.  The GPL and LGPL licenses have requirements stating that anyone who wishes to use the code will have to implement the code in the same, corresponding license.  On th other hand, the Apache/BSD licenses do not require that you use the same license. Instead, the researchers can redistribute code without restriction. All of the licenses involved made it so that the user cannot sue the creator of the program if the laptop suddenly goes haywire after running the program.
