##Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?

It is important to choose a license, because it is a statement that you are willing to let other users freely run, modify, and share the code that you post. Also, chooses a license dictates the legal conditions of whoever uses it, e.g. whether or not someone can sue the creator if the code messes up their machine.

##Why SHOULDN'T they use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?

Without a license, the code is "all rights reserved." No user other than the creator(s) will have the legal ability to anything with the code, and they will stay away from it. If the users don't have the rights, they won't want to consider helping you.

##Why Gopher failed and HTTP survived - Do you agree with this claim?

Yes, I agree with this claim. Gopher already made a huge mistake by not releasing their software early in order to build a community of users to help them with the coding. If there aren't many people involved in the creation of the code, there won't be many people who will 1. know about the creation and 2. use it.  Also, giving a discount to those associated with education (people who have .edu domains) went against the hacker ethic of discriminating against how certain groups of users can use the code.

##Can you justify why such a license is chosen (Justify for ONE is enough). Instead of these four, you can look at any other software project and justify the license chosen for that project.

Looking at the Microsoft .Net Core project, they used the MIT license. It would make sense to use this license, since it is a very open license and they seem to be very open to letting other users contribute to their code, as they have multiple documents designed to assist other users in both understanding their code and working with it. They even have a Developer Guide for potential contributors, so it is safe to assume that they are open to assistance from other users. If you want more coders to help you with your project, it would make sense to give them as much reign over how they use the code as possible.

##Which license is better?

For a developer, it is better to use the LGPL license, because it holds similar restrictions to the GPL, but it is not as limited. It is still possible to change the code and to keep the source code as long as you avoid redistributing the modified version to a third party.

For a company, it is better to use the Apache/BSD license, because they can use someone else's code, modify it, and release it for their own products without the requirement of releasing their own version of the code. This means that they are able to make their own products and profit from the modified code that they can claim to be their own.

For the common good, it is better to use the GPL license, because the presence of that license prevents other users from taking your code and making millions off of it without giving you any credit. Also, if someone makes changes to the code, they need to post their source code to ensure that other users are able to use it.
