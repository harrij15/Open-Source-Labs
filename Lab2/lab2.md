#Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?

It is important to choose a license, because it is a statement that you are willing to let other users freely run, modify, and share the code that you post. Also, chooses a license dictates the legal conditions of whoever uses it, e.g. whether or not someone can sue the creator if the code messes up their machine.

#Why SHOULDN'T they use a project that doesn't have an explicit license

Without a license, the code is "all rights reserved." No user other than the creator(s) will have the legal ability to anything with the code, and they will stay away from it. If the users don't have the rights, they won't want to consider helping you.
