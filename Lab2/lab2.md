##Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?

It is important to choose a license, because it is a statement that you are willing to let other users freely run, modify, and share the code that you post. Also, chooses a license dictates the legal conditions of whoever uses it, e.g. whether or not someone can sue the creator if the code messes up their machine.

##Why SHOULDN'T they use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?

Without a license, the code is "all rights reserved." No user other than the creator(s) will have the legal ability to anything with the code, and they will stay away from it. If the users don't have the rights, they won't want to consider helping you.

##Why Gopher failed and HTTP survived - Do you agree with this claim?

Yes, I agree with this claim. Gopher already made a huge mistake by not releasing their software early in order to build a community of users to help them with the coding. If there aren't many people involved in the creation of the code, there won't be many people who will 1. know about the creation and 2. use it.  Also, giving a discount to those associated with education (people who have .edu domains) went against the hacker ethic of discriminating against how certain groups of users can use the code.
